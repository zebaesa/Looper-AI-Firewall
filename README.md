**Looper-AI-Firewall** is an advanced **AI-powered Web Application Firewall** engineered for domination in the cybersecurity battlefield.

Developed under the **Looper Security** banner, this tool surgically analyzes and classifies malicious HTTP requests using a machine learning-driven URL inspection engineâ€”targeting server-side exploits like **LFI**, **RFI**, and **XSS**, as well as phishing vectors and spam attacks.

This isnâ€™t a project. Itâ€™s a weapon.
